# DropdownMenu-SwiftUI-Starter

This is a starter project for the Dropdown Menu tutorial that contains some things like certain modifiers and color assets. I wanted to do this to keep the video from being a lot longer than it has to be. Feel free to poke around and add or change anything youâ€™d like.

Cheers & Happy Coding!
